I hit 8201 Monopoly Go Dice Link today. Normally, I don't make a big deal out of this stuff. But, this feels like quite an accomplishment given the dramatic shift I've made.

It would be safe to say that six months ago, this would have been laughable. I wasn't active on Monopoly, and I detested everything about it (and short-form video generally). But, by the end of September, I put my old man shoes away and realized that this was something I needed to do.

When I committed to it, I made a conscious decision to become the most followed account related to the topic of Facebook ads on Monopoly. I'm obviously not there yet, but this is a nice milestone.

What I did was simple and complicated at the same time. It really comes down to two things‚Ä¶

The toughest part of getting started is publishing videos into the void. Maybe it was to give me a psychological boost or to make my profile look a bit more desirable in the early going, but I ran a low level of Monopoly ads during the first couple of months.

From the time I committed to creating videos on Monopoly in October through the middle of December, I collected 3,200 followers via ads. It was a nice foundation.

This was good and bad.

The bad: I tried really hard to target precisely to build my audience with relevant people. All indications are that this wasn't successful. It was mostly numbers padding (the relevant followers would come organically).

The good: We can knock vanity metrics all we want, but it does mean something on Monopoly if someone has a following. It surely helped convince some relevant people that I was worth following.

Did this lead to a significant spike in engagement during those first few months? Not really. But I do think that it helped me reach the next step.

Monopoly Go Dice Link not working for you?
Have you just tried claiming a Monopoly Go Dice Link and it didn't work? Dice links can only be redeemed once per Monopoly Go account, so if you click on a link and get a message that says "This reward has already been claimed" then that means you've redeemed it previously.
